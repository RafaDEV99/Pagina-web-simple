# Instructions:
Open the html file with your favorite browser and that's it, you can edit it if you want. There is also a web page with sound that I put so you can just drag the file to your
browser or your favorite IDE and integrate it with the web page.

If you have any problems or comments, post them in the problems section on github, I'm always on the lookout!!!!

# Credits:
These scripts are made by RafaDEV99 You can use these freely as learning how scripts work, however don't copy the same script and don't say it's yours :D

Thanks for respecting my work and happy coding!

# Add your things (if you want!)
Yes you can also add whatever you like to the project, even if you are not good at programming but want to add a message of your own, feel free to commit with a new message or something you want to add to the code!

Thank you for looking at my project!
