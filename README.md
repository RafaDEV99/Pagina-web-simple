# Instructions:
Open the html file with your favorite browser and that's it, you can edit it if you want. There is also a web page with sound that I put so you can just drag the file to your browser and integrate it with the web page.

If you have any problems or comments, post them in the problems section on github, I'm always on the lookout!!!!
